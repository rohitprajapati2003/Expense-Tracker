Expense Tracker Web Application 

The Expense Tracker Web Application is a simple web-based tool designed to help users 
record and manage their daily expenses. 
It allows users to add, view, and delete expense entries, while automatically calculating 
the total amount spent. 
This project uses only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and stores data in the browser using 
LocalStorage, making it lightweight and user-friendly.
